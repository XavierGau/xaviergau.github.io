    <h1>I have lost</h1>
        <p>I have grown, I have learnt, I have fallen, I have taken every moment I could get and held it softly against my chest. I have made mistake after mistake. You have given forgiveness. I love you. But somewhere, through the mistakes and the falling and the learning and the growing, I lost you. Your head left my shoulder, your heart longs for someone else. Your good mornings, your love yous, your eyes, oh your eyes, they belong to him now. I am just a passerby, a stranger, someone you avoid eye contact with. I lost. I am the loser. That is all I am. </p>
