    <h1>Tim</h1>
    <h3>By Xavier Gauci</h3>
    <p> “What would happen if the character walked out?” he jotted down on his absurdly loud keyboard that could probably be heard from next-door. Each click of a new letter, each clack from the spacebar, giving new meaning to the story he was fabricating. “Not just out the door, but out of the story. Where would he go? Who would he see?”  </p>
    <p></p>
      <p>He lifted his hands off the keyboard, placed them down on the desk, and stared at his monitor. </p>  
      <p></p>
        <p>Does he even exist without the story? Maybe the story follows him? </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The morning sun was shining under the roller blinds, glaring against the screen. He pushed himself up from his desk and started to get ready for another unremarkable day.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>This was Tim. Like his name, Tim was short, completely forgettable, and not particularly popular. Nothing in his life felt like it had any meaning. He dreamt of worlds far beyond his reach, places where the path he trod was his own and even the trains drifted without direction. There were adventures and heartbreaks, tears and joy, and every other cliché you can think of. He didn't just think up the stories, he wrote them down too. He found himself typing away many nights as thoughts ran through his mind, often too fast to read. When he entered that world, he could be someone else, someone that somehow felt more real and more alive than he had ever felt, and that person had a much cooler name than Tim.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As he arrived at work his thoughts flicked back to the world in his mind, thinking about where he would explore next, who he would meet, anything to avoid the reality that was in front of him. His job was shit, as he described it, or more-so how he would describe it if anyone cared to listen. He sat on a worn-down chair for nine hours a day, answered calls from pissed off customers, and watched as life kept moving past. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Today was different. The company had released a new product and it had been, unfortunately, massively successful. For each customer he delt with, another three would be placed on hold, waiting to make his day worse. He could feel himself becoming frustrated, the constant tapping of his colleagues answering calls, the sickly polite voices they are trained to use, the person in his head narrating his life. He was beginning to grind his teeth, scratch at his skin, tap his knee against the top of the desk.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>That same job, year after year. It never changed. He would sit at his computer, and wish he was home. Was today different? </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Where had his life gone? He never expected to end up here. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“I wish I knew,” he said. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“Uh, hello?” asked the caller, who had heard. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The system automatically placed the next customer onto the line, with not even as much as a warning for Tim who was too busy spacing out, escaping from what his life had become.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“I can hear you,” he said. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“Okay, I'm having trouble wit-” </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“Not you! This fucker above me.” </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>He could hear a voice, over his head, or perhaps it was inside it, he wasn't sure. It was repeating what he said, describing how he felt, explaining the scene that surrounded him. He jumped up from his desk, threw his headset to the ground, and shouted towards the ceiling. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>“Are you the reason my life is like this? Did you do this to me? I need to know.” </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>No, you are the reason it's like this. When was the last time you did something bold? Truly bold. Have you ever? Or have you always followed the concrete path, staying a train attached to your tracks? This is your story; you are the only one capable of changing it. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Said the narrator. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>The rest of the employees were staring at Tim, none even knowing his name. He looked crazy. He might have been. A new character had just been transferred to his line, waiting for him to pick up his headset. Maybe they would be his future partner, a best friend, an annoyance, a mistake, or more likely just another customer. He didn't know. He wouldn't know either, because he left. He walked out the door. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Something bold. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>He was running over what the narrator had said, again and again on his way home. This was his story. He had to change it. He had to be bold.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I wish I could tell you what happened next, but I can't.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>There is no more to tell.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I don't know how he did it, I don't know what it even means, but he left the story. He doesn't exist anymore. Did he ever exist? Maybe him leaving the story was what made it a story in the first place. Is it possible that this whole thing was a piece of fiction he typed up late at night with his absurdly loud keyboard that could probably be heard from next-door? </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I'm not sure what to do now, I have nothing left to narrate. There is no story without a character, without conflict, without passion. I hope Tim finds what he is looking for, perhaps he finds his way into a new story, one with more interesting writing, an adventure for him to pursue, and a fresh path to tread. I hope the author gives him a cool name. </p>
